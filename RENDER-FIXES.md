# Render Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Service Worker Asset Caching Errors
**Problem:** Service worker was trying to cache non-existent icon files (`icon-192x192.png`, `icon-512x512.png`)

**Fix:** 
- Updated `public/sw.js` to only cache existing icons (`icon-72x72.png`, `icon-96x96.png`)
- Changed caching strategy to handle missing files gracefully using `Promise.allSettled`
- Updated push notification icon references to use existing icons

### 2. Missing Icon References in HTML
**Problem:** `index.html` referenced non-existent icon files (`icon-128x128.png`, `icon-144x144.png`, `icon-152x152.png`)

**Fix:**
- Updated `index.html` to only reference existing icons
- Simplified icon declarations to use available sizes

### 3. Backend URL Environment Variable
**Problem:** App was still using Railway URL instead of environment variable

**Fix:**
- Updated `src/lib/config.ts` to prioritize environment variables
- Added warning when environment variable is not set
- Added development logging for debugging

## Next Steps (REQUIRED)

### Set Environment Variable in Render Dashboard

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your **nexus-frontend** service
3. Navigate to **Environment** tab
4. Add the following environment variable:
   - **Key:** `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
   - **Value:** Your backend URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.onrender.com`)

5. After adding the variable, Render will automatically rebuild your service

### Alternative Environment Variable Name

You can also use `VITE_API_URL` instead of `VITE_API_BASE_URL`:
   - **Key:** `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value:** Your backend URL

### Verify Deployment

After the rebuild:
1. The service worker should cache assets without errors
2. Icon files should load correctly
3. API calls should go to your configured backend URL instead of Railway
4. Check browser console for the warning message if env var is not set

## Testing Locally

Before deploying, test locally:

1. Create `.env` file in Nexus-Frontend root:
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. Rebuild:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Preview:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

4. Check browser console for:
   - No service worker caching errors
   - No 404 errors for icons
   - API calls going to correct backend URL

## Notes

- The app will fallback to Railway URL if no environment variable is set (with a warning)
- Service worker caching errors will no longer prevent installation
- All icon references now point to existing files only
